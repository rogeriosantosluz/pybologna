Thanks to joaomorais.com.br/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pybologna-0.1.2-py2.7.egg/bologna.py

v0.0.1 Simple engine to run a Text Game with few simple questions to build a Game, Players number and Players
v0.1.0 Game starts, # of players, choose players, Turns are working, economic options (buy/sell grain and land) are OK.

v0.1.1 Text to English, calculate population, better text format (tables) and screens

v0.1.2 get_input() is being used to treat input and raw_input compatibilities betweeen python 2 and 3

v0.1.3 TDD implemented. Please see the last lines of this code to run tests. 'Invasion' and 'Troops to buy' functions created. Best production random values. Invasion needs adjustments (barbarians are very efficient) and soldiers neeed to be summarized with villagers to adjust 20% militar population. 

TODO: initial variables for all levels, random values for production are very wide, need to implement market, black death, monetary, bank, maps, investments and promotions,
